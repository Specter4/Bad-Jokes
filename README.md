<h1>Bad-Jokes</h1>

Collection of bad Hungarian jokes which will hopefully make your day a little better. I think jokes are the best when you do not expect them, so I didn't want to create a joke book app that you download once, scroll through all the jokes and then never open it again. 

Instead: All you can do in this app is set notifications for when you want to get a joke to your homescreen. Set the joke timer to random/daily/weekly for notifications then forget about the app! It will trick you with really bad jokes from the background.

This app is in its alpha stage of development. This means that the game is under development and is improved on a regular basis â€“ through commits that add features and content, optimizations and bug fixes. You can clone the whole project and try it on your iPhone or in the Xcode simulator to get an idea! :smile:
