<h1>Bad-Jokes</h1>

Collection of bad Hungarian jokes which will hopefully make your day a little better. I think jokes are the best when you do not expect them, so I didn't want to create a joke book app that you download once, scroll through all the jokes and then never open it again. 

Instead: All you can do in this app is set notifications for when you want to get a joke to your homescreen. Set the joke timer to random/daily/weekly for notifications then forget about the app! It will trick you with really bad jokes from the background.
